This is a practice project using C# creating a math game. Using the C# Academy. 

These are the requirements, and optional requirements:
Requirements:

You need to create a game that consists of asking the player what's the result of a math question (i.e. 9 x 9 = ?), collecting the input and adding a point in case of a correct answer.

A game needs to have at least 5 questions.

The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.

Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation

You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.

You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

Optional Requirements:

Add difficulty levels.

Use a single method for all games.

Add a random operation mode.
